# Adoption guide

Use this guide when wiring Site Pipeline into a consumer repository.

## 1. Add the dependency

Install the package into the consumer site's Python environment with your chosen
package manager. During local development, a path dependency is also fine as
long as the consumer invokes the `site-pipeline` CLI from its managed runtime.

## 2. Create the site workspace

At minimum, the consumer repo should provide:

- `site/components.yaml`
- optional `site/site-pipeline.yaml`
- optional authored site content under `site/content/`

Example `site/site-pipeline.yaml`:

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
workspace:
  catalogPath: site/components.yaml
  authoredSiteContentPath: site/content
  stagePath: site/.stage
  previewPath: site/.preview
site:
  siteTitle: Example Project Site
  projectStatus: incubating
```

## 3. Define the component catalog

Each component entry needs a `slug` plus a checkout location:

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
defaults:
  metadataFile: site/component.yaml
  pagesRoot: site/pages
  docsRoot: site/docs
  assetsRoot: site/assets
components:
  - slug: example-component
    localDir: example-component
    displayName: Example Component
    repository: https://github.com/apache/example-component
```

## 4. Provide component-owned inputs

Each participating component repository should provide:

- `site/component.yaml`
- `site/pages/_index.md`
- optional additional `site/pages/**`
- optional `site/docs/**`
- optional `site/assets/**`

The component landing page body is authored by the component. The pipeline does
not inject a mandatory hero or action shell.

## 5. Invoke the pipeline

Run the pipeline from the consumer environment and pass an explicit repo root:

```bash
site-pipeline build --repo-root .
```

The resulting staged tree under `site/.stage/` becomes the single source of
truth for the downstream renderer.

## 6. Integrate the renderer

Point the consumer renderer at the staged outputs rather than at component
repositories directly.

The current stage contract exposes:

- `content/` for rendered page inputs,
- `data/` for generated component and lifecycle metadata,
- `static/` for versioned assets, and
- `manifest.yaml` for aggregate staging metadata.

## 7. Add local and CI workflows

Typical local workflows use:

- `site-pipeline build` for a full staged refresh,
- `site-pipeline watch` for interactive restaging, and
- `site-pipeline preview` for a deliberately barebones preview server. It is not
  a substitute for the consumer's real renderer.

In CI, run the pipeline before the site renderer so the published build always
consumes staged content from the contract boundary.

## Migration notes

If you are moving from an in-repo staging implementation to the extracted
package:

- call the installed `site-pipeline` CLI instead of importing private modules,
- pass `--repo-root` explicitly from consumer scripts,
- keep renderer helpers in the consumer repository, and
- update any build logic to read from `site/.stage/` instead of from component
  repos directly.
