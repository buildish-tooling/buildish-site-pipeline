"""Small setuptools wheel hook for final legal-file layout tweaks.

The project now relies on standard ``project.license-files`` metadata so
setuptools handles nearly all of the legal-file work for sdists and wheels.
That standard behavior intentionally preserves source-relative paths inside the
wheel's ``.dist-info/licenses/`` directory. For files declared as
``dist-release-legal/LICENSE`` and ``dist-release-legal/NOTICE``, that produces
paths under ``licenses/dist-release-legal/``.

For this project we want a narrower result:

* ``dist-release-legal/LICENSE`` should land at
  ``.dist-info/licenses/LICENSE``.
* ``dist-release-legal/NOTICE`` should land at
  ``.dist-info/licenses/NOTICE``.

The customization here deliberately stays small. Instead of reimplementing the
entire wheel build, we hook into ``bdist_wheel.egg2dist()``, let setuptools
copy the declared license files normally, then flatten the two curated paths
and rewrite the wheel ``METADATA`` ``License-File`` fields to match the final
archive layout.
